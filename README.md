RealConnect is the project developed during Facebook Hackathon Sydney 2018 by team RealConnect

## Idea

Meeting friends is tough once you leave school, people are busy, plans often fall through. Even when you do finally decide on a date and time that works, it can be even harder finding a place to eat that suits everyone!

## How

Display asking user for their free time and show their friends with common free time and near location so they can invite their friend. Displaying restaurants and other great-place-meet in the area.
